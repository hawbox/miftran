TODO for miftran					27.Dec.95

- Hrefs can't have spaces in them. (950811)

- Support spot cross-references (and add doc).
- Recognize <$xxx> in variables (e.g. date), do those substitutions.
- Handle SoftHyphen correctly (i.e. put the word back together).
- Improve translation tables to allow specifying "a.b" as a translation,
  rather than having to have a separate table for b.
- Figure out how to know where page breaks are in printed document,
  put horizontal lines and page numbers, headers, and footers there.
- Ability to do some path manipulation, e.g. to strip path and extension
  off graphics filename so that it can be put back into doc as "file.gif"
  and into external file for controlling image conversion.
- Fix fixchl so that <title> does not come after links.
- Add <head> and <body> to output.
- Add <DOCTYPE> line, e.g.:
	<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML//EN//2.0">

Documentation:
- Upgrade for current version
- Point out that users should use Makefile and miftran.rc from html dir as
  templates for their own docs.
- Add "style guide" section discussing what things will cause problems
  during translation (e.g. inconsistent use of paragraph tags).
- Document the paragraph types in the template, in case user wants to change
  document rather than template.  (e.g. "Chapter" turns into <h1> etc.)
- Graphics:
  - Must be included by reference

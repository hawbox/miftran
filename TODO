TODO for miftran					25.Apr.94

- Recognize variables (e.g. date), do those substitutions.
- Handle SoftHyphen correctly (i.e. put the word back together).
- Figure out how to handle tables.
- Improve translation tables to allow specifying "a.b" as a translation,
  rather than having to have a separate table for b.
- Figure out how to know where page breaks are in printed document,
  put horizontal lines and page numbers, headers, and footers there.

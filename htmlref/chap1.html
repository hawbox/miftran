<title>Miftran Users Guide: 1	 Overview</title>
<h1>1	 Overview</h1>
<p>
Miftran is a configurable translation program designed to translate Framemaker MIF 
(Maker Interchange Format) files into other text formats. By providing a customized initialization (or `rc') file, you can convert any MIF file into another useful text format. In 
particular, miftran has been designed to be able to produce reasonable HTML (Hypertext 
Markup Language) text files. In the rest of this document, the output is assumed to be 
HTML. If you plan on producing a format other than HTML, replace the word `HTML' 
in the remainder of this document with the name of the output format you are producing.<p>
<p>
<B>Note</B>:	This document is used as a sample MIF file to be run through miftran, as well as 
being a real manual that describes how to use the program. Thus there may be gratuitous use of formatting controls and cross-references. This is intended to better 
demonstrate the capabilities and use of miftran.<p>
<p>
The translation process is based upon the paragraph and font tags used in your MIF document. Your rc file specifies how those tags are to be translated into HTML. The configuration information in the rc file also includes input and output filenames and various other 
control information.<p>
<p>
For each document that you want to process, you will have to create an rc file which 
defines how the paragraph and font tags in that document are to be translated into HTML 
tags. This may take a couple of hours the first time you do it, but once you have your rc 
file you can continue to edit your MIF file and rerun miftran to get updated HTML files 
with no further work. If you have multiple documents that use the same set of paragraph 
tags, you can use the same rc file if it does not include the input filename, or you can copy 
your existing rc file for the new document, make the few changes required, and be ready 
to process the new document in a few minutes. For recommentations on how to set up 
your environment in which to do the translation, see

4</a>.<p>

<p>
The translation process reads the MIF file and transforms it through the following steps:<p>
<ul><li>lex - 
<a name="_IX_1">Lexical parsing (tokenizing). Separates the input into tokens for left and right angle 
brackets, numbers, and strings.<li>cmd - 
<a name="_IX_2">Command level parsing. Groups tokens into commands with start, end, or complete markers to indicate nesting.<li>tran - Translation. The MIF commands are translated into a series of non-nested commands according to an internal table. Most of the information in the MIF file is thrown 
away at this point. Tags, text, markers, and a few other things are kept. For advanced 
customization, you can edit the translation module to recognize more MIF keywords. 
Note that this module recognizes MIF keywords, which are defined by the MIF syntax, 
and which are not affected by the contents of any particular document.<li>sub - Substitution. Based on the configuration information in the rc file, substitutes specified strings in place of thefixed strings output from the translation stage. This is the 
stage at which paragraph tags such as `1Heading' would be converted to HTML markers such as `&lt;H1&gt;' and `&lt;/H1&gt;'.<li>fmt - Formatting. The subsituted string from the previous stage is passed through a formatter which looks for special % escapes, replacing them with specified data. Some % 
escapes have side effects, such as switching the output file, allowing you to do some 
crude programming by using the format strings. (For more sophisticated stuff, you can 
hack up the C code.)</ul><p>
By default, miftran will process the input file through all of these stages. For debugging 
purposes, you can give it a command line option (such as -tran) which will cause it to output the text after that stage of processing, allowing you to see better what's going on.<p>

<h1>3	 The RC File</h1>
<a name="_IX_7"><p>
The rc file controls the translation of your MIF file. The syntax of the rc file is identical 
to the syntax of a MIF file (the same parser is used internally), but the command keywords are different.<p>
<p>
Commands in a MIF file (and thus in an rc file) are surrounded by angle brackets (&lt;&gt;), 
and strings are surrounded by back- and forward-quotes (`'). Words which contain only 
alphabetic characters do not need to be quoted. Within the angle brackets, the command 
consists of a command keyword followed by the data (arguments) for that command, 
which are either integers, floats, or strings. For example, the infilename command in the 
rc file looks like this:<p>
<pre>&lt;infilename `foo.mif'&gt;</pre>
</ol></ul><p>
Commands in a real MIF file are similar, except that they may contain nested arguments. 
Commands in an rc fie do not contain nested arguments.<p>
<a name="3.1	"><h2>3.1	 Comments</h2>
<p>
You can include comments in your rc file by starting a line with the # character.<p>
<p>
A comment, starting with the # character, can also be placed on the same line as a command. The remainder of the line is treated as a comment.<p>
<p>
In a MIF file, lines starting with &amp; or = (only at the beginning of a line) are treated as 
comment lines. These lines are used to indicate an Inset in MIF (such as an embedded 
postscript file), which miftran does not handle.<p>
<a name="3.2	"><h2>3.2	 Commands</h2>
<p>
This section describes the commands that you can put into your rc file.<p>
<h3>3.2.1	 altoutfilename</h3>
<p>
Specifies a filename pattern for an alternate set of output files. These files are typically 
used for generating auxiliary data such as indexes. For example, you might specify<p>
<pre>&lt;altoutfile `d%d.txt'&gt;</pre>
</ol></ul><p>
Then in a substitution string you could use<p>
<pre>`%1.1A'</pre>
</ol></ul><p>
to switch to the output file d.txt.<p>
<h3>3.2.2	 eprint</h3>
<p>
Prints the specified message to stderr. For example<p>
<pre>&lt;eprint `Using RC file foo.rc'&gt;</pre>
<h3>3.2.3	 include</h3>
<p>
Includes the contents of the specified file as if it were part of the current file. Include 
statements can be nested. For example,<p>
<pre>&lt;include `std.rc'&gt;</pre>
</ol></ul><p>
will include the standard rc file.<p>
<p>
Note that if you mistakenly use the C preprocessor syntax (#include), the line will be 
treated as a comment, which makes the mistake much less obvious.<p>
<h3>3.2.4	 includedir</h3>
<p>
Specifies a directory in which to search for files specified with the &lt;include&gt; command. 
Multiple directories may be specified. The -I command line option can also be used to 
specify these directories.<p>
<h3>3.2.5	 infilename</h3>
<p>
Specifies the name of the input MIF file. If this command is not specified, the input filename can be specified on the command line.<p>
<pre>&lt;infilename `miftran.mif'&gt;</pre>
<h3>3.2.6	 init</h3>
<p>
Process the specified control string immediately. The tag and data strings will be blank. 
This is useful for doing initialization steps such as pre-loading registers or setting up 
output files.<p>
<h3>3.2.7	 outfilename</h3>
<p>
Specifies a filename pattern for the output files. If there is a single output file, the given 
name is that filename. If there are multiple output files, the pattern should include %d in 
it somewhere. For example,<p>
<pre>&lt;outfilename `chap%d.html'&gt;</pre>
</ol></ul><p>
Then you would switch to a new output file with a translation string such as<p>
<pre>`%+1.1F'</pre>
<h3>3.2.8	 print</h3>
<p>
Prints the specified message to stdout. For example<p>
<pre>&lt;print `Using RC file foo.rc'&gt;</pre>
<h3>3.2.9	 stringsub</h3>
<p>
Specifies a string translation. This command allows you to translate special characters or 
strings in the MIF file into other special strings in the output file. The first argument is 
the string to look for in the input, the second argument is what to replace it with in the 
output. For example, the &lt; character must be escaped in HTML files. This is accomplished with the command<p>
<pre>&lt;stringsub `&lt;' `&amp;lt;'&gt;</pre>
</ol></ul><p>
String substitution is part of the substitution stage of the translation process (see 
<a href="chap1.html#17541: Heading1: 1.1 The Translation Process">Section 
1.1, `The Translation Process' on page 2</a>). It occurs after type substitution and before 
formatting. String substitution is applied to the data string from the MI files before they 
are used in the formatting step.<p>
<h3>3.2.10	 tagalias</h3>
<p>
Specifies that the first tag name is to be treated the same as if it were the second tag 
name. This makes it much easier to set up your rc file for your document, since it means 
that you can specify in a single line how miftran should handle each of your paragraph 
tags (assuming miftran has a standard set of commands for dealing with that paragraph 
type). For example, the line<p>
<pre>&lt;typesub chapter MiftranChapter&gt;</pre>
</ol></ul><p>
tells miftran that your chapter paragraphs are tagged `chapter', and that it should handle 
those using its standard MiftranChapter definition.<p>
<h3>3.2.11	 typestringsub</h3>
<p>
Specifies a string substitution, to be executed only when in a paragraph of the specified 
type. This command allows you to translate special character or strings only when they 
appear in a specified paragraph type. For example, you could use the following command to turn tabs into spaces only in the `chapter' paragraph type:<p>
<pre>&lt;typestringsub chapter `\\x11 ' ` '&gt;</pre>
<h3>3.2.12	 <a name="40489: Subsection: 3.1.7 typesub">typesub</h3>
<p>
Specifies a type substitution. This command allows you to specify what gets output for 
specific paragraph and font tags. This is the primary way in which you can customize 
your rc file for your document.<p>
<p>
The results of the translation step of the entire translation process is a series of commands indicating a state transition, a tag string (such as a paragraph tag), and a data 
string. You can see this data stream by using the -tran command line option, which tells 
miftran to stop processing immediately after the translation step and output those results. 
A sample of this output looks like this:<p>
<pre>startpgf Chapter
string Chapter Overview
endpgf Chapter
switchpgf Chapter.Body</pre>
</ol></ul><p>
In each line, the first item is the state transition name, the second is the tag, and the third 
is the data string. In the typesub command, you specify the same three pieces of data in 
the same order. The difference is that, in the typesub command, the third piece of data is 
typically a format string that determines what gets output. For example, you might 
include the command<p>
<pre>&lt;typesub startpgf Chapter `&lt;h1&gt;%s&lt;/h1&gt;'&gt;</pre>
</ol></ul><p>
which would result in the output string<p>
<pre>&lt;h1&gt;Overview&lt;/h1&gt;</pre>
</ol></ul><p>
in your output file, given the above example as input.<p>
<p>
You can use a `*' in place of the tag to specify that that typesub should match on all tag 
types (sorry, no partial patterns are allowed).<p>
<p>
The switchpgf state uses a dual paragraph tag of the form fromtag.totag, such as is used 
in the above example. In this case, you can specify a `*' in place of one or the other tags 
to indicate that that typesub should match on all paragraph tags for that part of the transition. For example, you could specify<p>
<pre>&lt;typesub switchpgf `*.Bullet' `&lt;ul&gt;'&gt;</pre>
</ol></ul><p>
which would output &lt;ul&gt; whenever a paragraph of type Bullet followed a paragraph of 
any other type.<p>
<p>
For a list of all of the state names that can be specified in a typesub command, see 
<a href="chap3.html#41291: Section: 3.2 State Names">Section 3.2, `State Names' on page 8</a>. For more information about the formatting string 
(third arg to typesub), see 
<a href="chap3.html#28642: Section: 3.3 Format Strings">Section 3.3, `Format Strings' on page 10</a>.<p>
<a name="41291: Section: 3.2 State Names"><a name="3.3	"><h2>3.3	 State Names</h2>
<p>
The first argument to the typesub command is a state name as output by the tran stage of 
the translation process. The set of state names is defined in C code. An advanced user 
can expand the set of state names by editing the C source (see 
<a href="chap4.html#40965: Chapter: 4 Advanced Customization">Chapter 4, `Advanced 
Customization' on page 13</a>). The currently defined state names are described in this section.<p>
<p>
In the following descriptions, MIF commands in the input file are referred to with angle 
brackets around them, such as &lt;Char&gt; and &lt;PgfTag&gt;.<p>
<p>
These commands are specified in a transition table in miftran. The table is hierarchical. 
In the description of the state transitions given below, only the last (leaf) command is 
mentioned, although the complete command hierarchy must appear in the input file. For 
example, the &lt;XRefSrcText&gt; command mentioned below is actually nested. To be more 
precise, it should be noted as &lt;Para&gt;/&lt;ParaLine&gt;/&lt;XRef&gt;/&lt;XRefSrcText&gt;. In practice, 
it is not necessary to know this, since it is how the MIF files are generated anyway. For 
the advanced user who is examining the C source code, the structure is apparent from 
the hierarchical definition tables.<p>
<p>
Unless otherwise specified, the tag argument is the current paragraph tag, as set by the 
most recent &lt;PgfTag&gt; command in the input.<p>
<h3>3.3.1	 aframe</h3>
<p>
Generated in response to the &lt;AFrame&gt; command in a text flow. The data string is the

MIF file looks like this:<p>
<pre>&lt;hypertext `gotolink target_label'&gt;</pre>
</ol></ul><p>
The tag is the hypertext command word (such as `gotolink' or `openlink'); the data 
string is the remainder of the hypertext command.<p>
<h3>3.3.14	 markertext</h3>
<p>
Generated in response to a &lt;MText&gt; command. The tag is a string version of the marker

<a name="28642: Section: 3.3 Format Strings"><a name="3.4	"><h2>3.4	 Format Strings</h2>
<p>
The third argument to the typesub command (see 
<a href="chap3.html#40489: Subsection: 3.1.7 typesub">Subsection 3.1.7, `typesub' on page 7</a>) 
is a formatting string. This string controls what is actually written to the output file, and 
also controls other aspects, such as when to switch output files.<p>
<p>
The string (within quotes `') can contain any printing characters, plus backslash-escaped 
characters (such as \n for a newline) plus % formatting commands. Any printing characters are sent to the current output file, backslash-escaped characters are interpreted and 
sent on to the output file, and % formatting is processed, which may or may not result in 
additional data being sent to the output file.<p>
<p>
The different parts of the format string are discussed in the following sections.<p>
<a name="3.5	"><h2>3.5	 Backslash Sequences</h2>
<p>
A string can be continued on the next line of input by placing a backslash as the last 
character on the line. The backslash and following newline are not part of the resulting 
string.<p>
<p>
The valid characters which can appear after a backslash (\) are:<p>
<ul><li><I>newline</I> - line continuation<li>n - output a newline<li>t - output a tab<li>' - output a single quote<li>\ - output a backslash</ul><p>
The results of putting any other character following a backslash is officially undefined, 
although the current implementation will output that character.<p>
<a name="3.6	"><h2>3.6	 Percent Sequences</h2>
<p>
The % formatting control characters are divided into two classes: those with side-effects, and those without. The formatting controls without side effects only output data 
to the current output file, whereas the ones with side-effects can do all sorts of things. 
Control characters which have side effects are all upper case, such as %A and %F. Control characters without side effects are all lower case, such as %s and %f.<p>
<p>
The actual % format is similar to printf, but with an extension to allow a literal string to 
be specified. It contains the following parts:<p>
<ol><li>The initial % character.<li>An optional + or - character.<li>An optional integer. This number is referred to as N1.<li>An optional dot and integer. This number is referred to as N2.<li>An optional double-quote character, followed by a string, followed by a closing double quote character. A double quote character can be included in the string by preceding it with a backslash. A backslash can be included in the string by using a 
double-backslash. This string is referred to as S.<li>The format control character.</ol>
<p>
There are two banks of registers that are accessed by some of the commands, one set for 
integer data, and one set for string data. There are 99 registers, numbered from 1 to 99. 
References to illegal register numbers are quietly ignored. You can change the number 
of registers by recompiling miftran. See 
<a href="chap4.html#40965: Chapter: 4 Advanced Customization">Chapter 4, `Advanced Customization' on page 
13</a>.<p>
<a name="3.7	"><h2>3.7	 Format Control Characters</h2>
<p>
The format control characters are described in the following paragraphs.<p>
<h3>3.7.1	 %%</h3>
<p>
The % format control characters causes a single % character to be written to the output.<p>
<h3>3.7.2	 %A</h3>
<p>
The A format control character directs output to one of the 
<a name="_IX_8">alternate output files. N1 is 
the value to plug into a %d in the output filename, as specified by the altoutfilename 
command in the rc file. If a + or - is specified, then N1 is added to the current alternate 
file number, and the result is used as the new current alternate file number. N2 is the 
mode: 0 means switch to an already open file; 1 means open with mode w; 2 means open 
with mode a. By definition, the string %A is equivalent to %+0A.<p>
<h3>3.7.3	 %E</h3>
<p>
The E format control character stores the value of the environment variable specified by 
S into string register N1. For example, the command<p>
<pre>&lt;init `%1"DOC_TITLE"E'&gt;</pre>
</ol></ul><p>
gets the value of the environment variable DOC_TITLE and places it into string register 
1 during initialization.<p>
<p>
If the + character is specified, then the value of the environment variable is passed to atoi 
(which converts the string into an integer), and the return value of atoi is stored in integer register N1. If the string is blank (such as if the environment variable is unset), then 
0 is stored into integer register N1. If the string is not a valid integer, the results are 
undefined.<p>
<h3>3.7.4	 %F</h3>
<p>
The F format control character directs output to one of the 
<a name="_IX_9">primary output files. N1 is the 
value to plug into a %d in the output filename, as specified by the outfilename command 
in the rc file. If a + or - is specified, then N1 is added to the current primary file number, 
and the result is used as the new current primary file number. N2 is the mode: 0 means 
switch to an already open file; 1 means open with mode w; 2 means open with mode a. 
By definition, the string %F is equivalent to %+0F.<p>
<h3>3.7.5	 %H</h3>
<p>
The H format control character causes miftran to do a callback to the typesub for 
`hypertext endanchor' on the next font change. This allows simple rc definitions to handle the hyperlink commands in the MIF file. The standard include file std.rc has definitions to handle these commands. Look for the word `hypertext' in that file to see the 
definitions.<p>
<h3>3.7.6	 %L</h3>
<p>
The L format control character loads literal data into an internal register. N1 specifies the 
register number. If the + character is specified, then N2 is loaded into integer register 
N1. If no + character is specified, then S is loaded into string register N1.<p>
<h3>3.7.7	 %O</h3>
<p>
The O format control character performs an 
<a name="_IX_10">operation on two registers. If the + character 
is specified then the operation is performed on the integer registers, else the operation is 
performed on the string registers. N1 and N2 specify the two registers to use and S specifies the name of the operation to perform. The results are placed into register N1. The 
list of operations names is given in 
<a href="chap3.html#24978: Section: 3.7 Register Operations">Section 3.7, `Register Operations For Integers' on 
page 12</a>.<p>
<h3>3.7.8	 %R</h3>
<p>
The R format control character loads data into an internal register. N1 specifies the register number. If the + character is specified, then integer data is extracted from the data 
string and stored into the specified register. N2 is used to determine which integer to 
extract, and is 0 based. For example, if N2 is 1 and the data string is `a12b25c30', then 
the number 25 is stored into the specified integer register.<p>
<p>
If no + character is specified, the current data string is stored into the specified register.<p>
<p>
The data string used as the source for this command is the current string data for the 
translation being formatted. If N1 is not in the legal range, it is silently ignored. Note 
that %R is equivalent to %0R and will thus be ignored.<p>
<h3>3.7.9	 %S</h3>
<p>
The S format control character directs the output stream to string register N1. All output 
goes into that register until redirected by another %S or %A command. This is used, for 
example, to implement part headings in the standard include file part.rc.<p>
<h3>3.7.10	 %X</h3>
<p>
The X format control character executes an extended command. The name of the command is given by S. The list of extended commands is given in 
<a href="chap3.html#60755: Section: 3.9 Extended Commands">Section 3.9, `Extended 
Commands' on page 13</a>.<p>
<h3>3.7.11	 %f</h3>
<p>
The f format control character prints the primary output filename to the output. N1 is the 
value to plug into a %d in the output filename, and is calculated in the same way as for 
the %F format.<p>
<h3>3.7.12	 %n</h3>
<p>
The n format control character outputs a newline if the last character of the associated 
data is a space. This hack provides a way to output a newline at a safe place in the output 
file. If the data does not end in a space, it may be in the middle of a word, so it is not safe 
to output a newline.<p>
<h3>3.7.13	 %r</h3>
<p>
The r format control character prints out the contents of the register specified by N1. If 
this register has never been set, or if N1 is not a valid register number, then nothing is 
output. Note that %r is equivalent to %0r, and does nothing.<p>
<h3>3.7.14	 %s</h3>
<p>
The s format control character prints out the entire data string.<p>
<a name="24978: Section: 3.7 Register Operations"><a name="3.8	"><h2>3.8	 Register Operations For Integers</h2>
<p>
This section describes the register operations that can be specified for integer registers in 
a %O control sequence.<p>
<h3>3.8.1	 add</h3>
<p>
The integer add (or +) command adds the value in integer register N2 to the value in 
integer register N1 and places the result in integer register N1.<p>
<h3>3.8.2	 subtract</h3>
<p>
The integer subtract (or -) command subtracts the value in integer register N2 from the 
value in integer register N1 and places the result in integer register N1.<p>
<h3>3.8.3	 copy</h3>
<p>
The integer copy command sets integer register N1 to the value in integer register N2.<p>
<a name="3.9	"><h2>3.9	 Register Operations For Strings</h2>
<p>
This section describes the register operations that can be specified for string registers in 
a %O sequence.<p>
<h3>3.9.1	 cat</h3>
<p>
The string cat command places the concatenation of string register N1 followed by 
string register N2 into string register N1.<p>
<h3>3.9.2	 copy</h3>
<p>
The string copy command makes a copy of string register N2 and places it into string 
register N1.<p>
<h3>3.9.3	 get</h3>
<p>
The string get command gets the value of the symbol named by string register N2 and 
places it into string register N1.<p>
<h3>3.9.4	 set</h3>
<p>
The string set command sets the symbol named by string register N2 to the value in 
string register N1.<p>
<a name="60755: Section: 3.9 Extended Commands"><a name="3.10	"><h2>3.10	 Extended Commands</h2>
<p>
This section describes the extended commands available by using a %X sequence.<p>
<h3>3.10.1	 skip</h3>
<p>
The skip command skips through the MIF input file until the end of the current level is 
reached. This is useful for skipping disabled conditional text.<p>

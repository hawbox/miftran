<title>Miftran Users Guide: 2	 Usage</title>
<h1>Usage</h1>
<p>
This chapter describes how to run miftran.
<p>
<h2>2.1	 <a name="27401: Section: 2.1 Requirements">Requirements
</h2>
<p>
In order to run miftran, you will need two things (other than miftran itself):
<p>
<ol><li>A MIF file to use as input. This is normally specified in the rc file, but can also be 
given on the command line
<li>An rc file to control the translation. The default is `miftran.rc' in the current directory, 
or you can use the MIFTRANRC environment variable, or the -rc command line 
option. See 
<a href="chap3.html#32917: Chapter: 3 The RC File">Chapter 3, `The RC File' on page 5
</a>.
</ol>
<p>
You makeyour MIF file from Frame using the Save As command. You create your rc file 
using your favorite text editor.
<p>
<p>
Miftran is designed to accept a single MIF file as input, but it can produce multiple output 
files. Thus you can create a separate output file for each chapter of your document (or each 
section, or whatever else you select). This is appropriate for hypertext browsers, where 
each chunk is typically considerably smaller than what goes into a MIF file (such as this 
entire document).
<p>
<p>
The simplest way to use miftran is to create a directory in which to produce the output 
files, and to place your rc file into that directory. You can put a simple makefile into the 
directory so that you don't have to remember how to run miftran; then you can simply cd 
into that directory and type `make' in order to update your HTML files.
<p>
<h2>2.2	 Command Line Options
</h2>
<p>
Miftran includes only a few 
<a name="_IX_3">command line options, mainly for debugging. The 
<a name="_IX_4">debugging 
command line options (-cmd, -fmt, -lex, -sub, -tran) allow you to control which phases of 
the translation are performed by miftran (see 
<a href="chap1.html#17541: Heading1: 1.1 The Translation Process">Section 1.1, `The Translation Process' on 
page 2
</a>). Other options are:
<p>
<ul><li>-version - 
<a name="_IX_5">print the version of miftran and exit.
<li>-rc 
<I>filename
</I> - specify the name of the rc file to use.
</ul><p>
An additional argument not starting with `-' is assumed to bean input filename. A single 
`-' specifies that input is to come from stdin. Input will also be taken from stdin if no 
input file is specified (either on the command line or in the rc file).
<p>
<p>
There are no command line options to specify output files. The output file or files are nor
mally specified in the rc file (see 
<a href="chap3.html#32917: Chapter: 3 The RC File">Chapter 3, `The RC File' on page 6
</a>), and are processed 
during the fmt stage of the translation (see 
<a href="chap1.html#17541: Heading1: 1.1 The Translation Process">Section 1.1, `The Translation Process' on page 
2
</a>). Thus if you use one of the debugging command line options to get early output, it will 
always come to stdout.
<p>
<h2>2.3	 Environment
</h2>
<p>
Miftran uses the following 
<a name="_IX_6">environment variables:
<p>
<ul><li>MIFTRANRC - if set and no rc file was specified on the command line, uses the value 
as the name of the rc file to use.
</ul><h2>2.4	 Postprocessing
</h2>
<p>
Miftran makes a single pass through the document and produces one or more output files. 
In order to properly handle forward cross references, a second pass of some sort needs to 
be made. This is handled by an external script, called fixref, which uses a data file pro
duced by miftran in order to update the cross references in the HTML files. Control over 
production of the data file is contained in the miftran rc file.
<p>
<p>
The fixref script is normally included as part of the make procedure as defined in the 
Makefile for the HTML documents.

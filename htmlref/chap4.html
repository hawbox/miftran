<h1>Advanced Customization</h1>
<p>
For most use, configuration through the rc file will be sufficient. But you may decide that 
you need to recognize additional information in the MIF file, or need new formatting 
capabilities. Miftran has been designed to make it realtively easy to do this. This chapter 
describes briefly how this is done.
<p>
<p>
Note that since the rc file is parsed by the same routines as the data file, the directions for 
recognizing additional MIF constructs apply also to adding a new rc file command.
<p>
<p>
You can easily customize the C source for any of the following:
<p>
<ul><li>Recognize additional MIF constructs
<li>Add an rc file command
<li>Add another format control character (with or without side effects)
</ul><p>

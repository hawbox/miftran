<h1>4	 Advanced Customization</h1>
<p>
For most use, configuration through the rc file will be sufficient. But you may decide that 
you need to recognize additional information in the MIF file, or need new formatting 
capabilities. Miftran has been designed to make it relatively easy to do this. This chapter 
describes briefly how this is done.<p>
<p>
Note that since the rc file is parsed by the same routines as the data file, the directions for 
recognizing additional MIF constructs apply also to adding a new rc file command.<p>
<p>
You can easily customize the C source for any of the following:<p>
<ul><li>Recognize additional MIF constructs<li>Add an rc file command<li>Add another format control character (with or without side effects)<li>Change the number of registers available for % formatting commands.</ul><a name="4.1	"><h2>4.1	 Recognizing an Additional MIF Construct</h2>
<p>
Miftran uses a table-driver parse to recognize specific constructs in its input stream. The 
tables describe a tree structure which represents the nesting of the commands in the 
input file. When the parser gets to a leaf of the tree, it executes a function associated 
with that leaf to do the processing for that command. The function could do whatever 
you want, but most functions so little more than invoking a translation command, whose 
definition is specified in the rc file. In this way, miftran essentially takes the hierarchical 
structure in a MIF file and presents it as a flat structure which is handled by the rc commands.<p>
<p>
Flattening the structure of the input file in this way works quite well for the large majority of processing, and makes the user's job of specifying translations much simpler than 
if he had to deal with the full hierarchy. If you want to recognize additional constructs in 
a similar vein, and turn them into flattened commands, it should be pretty easy to do. If 
you need to deal with the full hierarchy of the input structure, that's a lot more work, and 
you're on your own.<p>
<p>
To recognize another MIF construct, you must first know what the hierarchical specification for that construct it. To do this, you may have to slog through a couple of example 
MIF files to see what they look like. Fortunately, MIF is a text format, so it's pretty easy 
to browse through it with your favorite text editor.<p>
<p>
Once you know the hierarchical structure of the command in MIF, you need to determine how much of that command (if any) is represented in the existing tables in miftran. 
These tables are in the file 
<TT>mtproc.c</TT>. For example, if you were trying to add the command<p>
<pre>&lt;TextFlow &lt;Para &lt;ParaLine &lt;Font &lt;FUnderline&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</pre>
</ol></ul><p>
you would discover that<p>
<pre>&lt;TextFlow &lt;Para &lt;ParaLine &lt;Font&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</pre>
</ol></ul><p>
is already represented in the tables, so all you have to do is add a table entry for 
&lt;FUnderline&gt; (to 
<TT>FontTranTab</TT> in 
<TT>mtproc.c</TT>). If, however, you wanted to recognize<p>
<pre>&lt;ConditionCatalog &lt;Condition &lt;CTag&gt;&gt;&gt;</pre>
</ol></ul><p>
you would discover that none of these are represented in the existing tables, so you 
would have to add them all, starting with ConditionCatalog (in 
<TT>TopTranTab</TT> in 
<TT>mtproc.c</TT>).<p>
<p>
Once you have determined which trantab (translation table, of type 
<TT>MtSidTran[]</TT>) to 
add your new keywords to, you need to add one table for each level of the command 
hierarchy which does not already exist. Each line in the table specifies a command, and 
refers to either another table, or (for the last command) a function to execute. Look the 
existing trantabs in 
<TT>mtproc.c</TT> to see how it's done.<p>
<p>
After getting your tables set up, you are ready to write the action function which is 
called from the final entry in your table. The function you will most likely want to call 
from your action routine is 
<TT>MtSubSid</TT>. For example, this is the function that is called 
by 
<TT>MtProcString</TT> to do the standard processing for text in the input file. Take a look 
at that function (in mtproc.c) and the others for examples of how to process the data. In 
most cases, your action routine should not have to be more than a few lines long. You 
may have to add an additional MT_O_* definition, which goes at the beginning of 
<TT>mtproc.c</TT>.<p>
<a name="4.2	"><h2>4.2	 Adding an RC File Command</h2>
<p>
The RC commands are described in the file 
<TT>mtrc.c</TT>. The 
<TT>RcTranTab</TT> table lists the 
commands and their action functions. To add another command, just add a line to that 
table and write the associated action routine. Look at the existing action routines in 
<TT>mtrc.c</TT> for examples.<p>
<p>
Note that, since RC files are parsed with the same parser as MIF files, adding an RC 
command is just a special case of recognizing an additional MIF construct, as described 
in the previous section. This means that, if you really wanted to, you could add a hierarchical RC command using the same techniques as described for MIF files.<p>
<a name="4.3	"><h2>4.3	 Adding Another Format Control Character</h2>
<p>
The format control characters are defined in the function 
<TT>MtSubFmt</TT> in the file 
<TT>mtfmt.c</TT>. There is a switch statement with a case for each valid character. Take a look 
at that switch statement for examples.<p>
<p>
Extended commands are defined in the table 
<TT>MtXCmdTab</TT> in the file 
<TT>mtfmt.c</TT>. You 
can add a new extended command by adding a line to that table and writing the associated action function.<p>
<p>
Register operations are defined in the file 
<TT>mtop.c</TT>. The table 
<TT>MtOpIntTab</TT> lists all of 
the integer operations, and the table 
<TT>MtOpStrTab</TT> lists all of the string operations. To 
add a new operations, edit the appropriate table and add a new line with the operation 
name and function. See the existing functions in that file for examples of how to implement new operation functions.<p>
<a name="4.4	"><h2>4.4	 Changing the Number of Registers</h2>
<p>
You can increase the number of registers available for use in % formatting commands. 
The number of registers is controlled by the constant 
<TT>NUMREGISTERS</TT> defined in 
<TT>mtfmt.c</TT>. You can edit that file and change that definition, or define that number in the 
makefile for miftran to be higher. You must recompile miftran with the higher value in 
order to change the number of registers.<p>

miftran v0.7 29.May.1996

	Enhancements
	------------
	- The -sub command line option (for debugging) now includes the
	  translation information as output by -tran, plus the final
	  formatted output along with the formatting string which
	  is the output of the substitution stage.  The formatting string
	  is output in square brackets to distinguish it from the text.
	  Output redirection is disabled so that all output comes to stdout
	  in this mode.  These additions make debugging easier.

	Bug Fixes
	---------

	Other Changes
	-------------
	- The standard configuration now produces .htm files instead of
	  .html files, to make like easier for those poor souls who are
	  forced to use systems limited to 3 character extentions.
	  (Changes from html to htm were in fixchl, fixindex, fixref
	  html/miftran.rc, html/Makefile, mtinc/stdhead.rc)

miftran v0.6 27.Dec.1995

	Enhancements
	------------
	- Add support for flat tables (courtesy of Mogaki Masato).

	- You can now specify paragraph-specific translations for markers and
	  hypertext.  Previously, you could only specify somethis like this:
	    <typesub markertext `2' `.....'>
	  To specify that this translation only applies in paragraph type xyz:
	    <typesub markertext `xyz.2' `.....'>
	  You could also specify `*.2' to do the same thing as `2'.

	- Add elipsis (c9) to strsub.rc.

	Bug Fixes
	---------
	- Change anchfram.rc so that anchored frames without external
	  filenames do not appear in the output.

	- Font changes across soft line breaks now work properly (thanks
	  to Robert Sechrest).

	- Fix minor memory leak in MtPutRegStr.

	- Fix bug in fixref that ate final lines without newline.

	Other Changes
	-------------
	- The files mtinc/chap[12].rc have been combined into chap.rc.
	  To select whether or not second-level headers go into the generated
	  TOC, select either the paragraph type MiftranH2 or MiftranH2nt
	  (no table-of-contents) as your paragraph type alias.

miftran v0.5p1 21.Sep.1995

	Enhancements
	------------
	- The new file mtinc/spanish.rc contains stringsub commands for
	  Spanish characters (courtesy of Pedro Antonio Acebes Bayon).

	Changes
	-------
	- The file mtinc/std.rc has been split up into many smaller files.
	  This makes it simpler to pick and choose if you don't want all of
	  std.rc.

	Bug Fixes
	---------
	- Added missing </a> after <a name=...>.

miftran v0.5 19.Jun.1995

	Enhancements
	------------
	- Added <include> and <includedir> commands to allow nested includes
	  of rc files.  Added -I command to specify include directories.

	- Added <typestringsub pgftype from to> to do string substitutions
	  only in specific paragraph types.

	- Added %E format, stores value of specified env var into register.

	- Added support for <Char EnDash> (similar to emdash).

	- <typesub switchpgf `A.A' `...'> now works, and will be substituted
	  when PgfTag A is followed by another PgfTag A.
	  <typesub switchpgf `A.*' `...'> (and *.A) will not take effect
	  when PgfTag A is followed by another PgfTag A.

	- Insets in MIF files are now ignored (all lines with first character
	  '=' or '&' are treated as comments).

	- Updated the manual to reflect this version.  Chapter 5 (examples)
	  was removed, since there were no examples.

	Bug Fixes
	---------
	- Fixed bug in %+m.nR. (Thanks to Steve Tynor.)

	- Added <typesub varref MiftranIgnore `'> to prevent varref junk
	  in headers and footers from appearing in output. (Steve Tynor)

	- Char (e.g. <Char Tab>) now properly occurs inside startpgf/endpgf.

	- Emdash in MiftranIgnore paragraphs no longer prints.

miftran v0.4p1 31.Oct.1994

	Enhancements
	------------
	- Added <tagalias Normal MiftranBody>.

	- Modified miftran.rc to take out default input filename; the makefile
	  now specifies the input filename.  This makes it simpler to use
	  the same miftran.rc file for multiple mif files, as long as they
	  use the same set of paragraph and font tags.
	
	- Modified html/Makefile to allow overriding mif source file and
	  miftran.rc file on command line, to make it possible to use
	  the same makefile for multiple mif files and directories.

	- Modified html/Makefile to remove chap0.html if it is empty.

	Bug Fixes
	---------
	- Fixed unrevealed bug in MtXCmd, would have caused problem if
	  command table had had more than one command in it.

	- Fixed bug in Skip command that caused it to skip too much.

miftran v0.4 18.Aug.1994

	NOTE: this release includes a change to the semantics of a
	      %F in the miftran.rc file; you should use %+0F to keep
	      the old semantics.

	Enhancements
	------------
	- Added "to unpack" notes to README file.

	- Added %X format control for extended commands.  Added %"skip"X
	  command to allow skipping all processing until the current
	  level is ended.

	- The new %S format allows output to be directed into one of the
	  string registers.  This simplifies rc code that needs to collect
	  input, such as the MiftranChapter translation.

	- Added support for ignoring hidden conditional text.  This is done
	  with the new <typesub textflowtag...> command.  Assuming that
	  the textflow tag is `HIDDEN', the default translation of
	  `%"skip"X' will skip everything in that text flow.

	- Added translation of <FWeight> tag to "startfontweight" and
	  translation of <FAngle> tag to "startfontangle" (in the same
	  manner as FTag currently gets translated to "startfont".
	  (Suggested by Ralf Hauser)

	Bug Fixes
	---------
	- Variables in chapter titles are now handled correctly (by using
	  the new %S construct).

	- In the French character section of miftran.rc, changed stringsub
	  for `&uacute;' to 9c from 9f (which is actually uumlaut).

	Changes
	-------
	- %F now switches back to the most recent output mode (normal file,
	  alternate file, or string register), rather than always switching
	  to the normal output file (you can do that with %+0F).

miftran v0.3p1 10.Jun.1994

	Enhancements
	------------
	- Added support for simple variables.  Does not attempt to
	  translate <$xxx> stuff within variables, that text will appear
	  as is in the output.  The variables definition is handled with
	  <typesub varname ...> and <typesub vardef ...> commands, and the
	  reference is handled with <typesub varref ...>.

	- Added notes to the README file, simple directions for setting up
	  your own document.

miftran v0.3 1.Jun.1994

	Enhancements
	------------
	- Added recognition of hypertext commands.  These are done with
	  a miftran.rc line such as the following:
		<typesub hypertext gotolink `link to %s'>
	  The new format %H sets an internal flag that causes miftran
	  to look for a 'typesub hypertext endanchor' just before the
	  next font change.

	- Added recognition for hardspace and hardhyphen (similar to
	  hardreturn).

	- Added pgf.list and font.list tags to makefile, to make it easy
	  to get a list of the paragraph and font tags used in the mif file.

	- Added new format %n to add a conditional newline if the last
	  character of the data is a space.

	- Added purify tag to miftran makefile.

	Bug Fixes
	---------
	- Fixed some memory bugs in the string op functions.

	- Changed "\n" in default string translation to "%n".  This prevents
	  extraneous spaces from being inserted into the output.

miftran v0.2p2 12.May.1994

	Enhancements
	------------
	- Added the MiftranIgnore paragraph type to the default miftran.rc
	  file to ignore headers and footers.

	- Added stringsub lines for French characters to miftran.rc
	  (courtesy of Fabrice Gaillard).

	Bug Fixes
	---------
	- If no cross-refs in fixref, just exit rather than bombing.

	- Added trailing space in German Umlaut character translations.

	- Added missing "{ 0 }" to trantabs for anchored frame stuff.

miftran v0.2p1 2.May.1994

	Enhancements
	------------
	- Added stringsub lines for German Umlauts to miftran.rc
	  (courtesy of Stefan Lohrum).

	Bug Fixes
	---------
	- Adding missing double quotes for href lines in fixchl.

miftran v0.2  25.Apr.1994

	Enhancements
	------------
	- The new <tagalias> rc command provides a mechanism for easily
	  specifying that one tag should be treated the same as another.
	  This also makes it simpler to customize the standard RC file
	  for your document tags, since the tagalias commands all appear
	  grouped together near the start of the RC file.

	- The new <init> rc command provides a mechanism for specifying
	  special translations to be executed immediately when reading
	  the RC file.  This is useful for such things as loading registers
	  with constant values (such as the document title).

	- The new commands <aframeid>, <aframefile> and <aframe> provide
	  for handling of anchored frames.  New lines in the default
	  miftran.rc file generate <img> lines in the output which
	  reference the input filename.  You'll still have to handle
	  the image format conversion outside of miftran.

	- The new %O operators "get" and "set" implement a simple symbol
	  table.  The format %1.2"get"O will use the name in string
	  register 2, retrieve that value, and store it into string
	  register 1.  The format %1.2"set"O will store the value from
	  string register 1 into the name specified by string register 2.
	  This feature is used for the default anchored frame conversion.

	- Modified fixindex script to handle Emphasis in index lines.

	- Added fixchl script to better deal with adding "Next Chapter" and
	  "Previous Chapter" links (rather than trying to do it in the
	  rc file).  Links are now placed at both the start and end of
	  each chapter file (if the corresponding next/previous chapter
	  file exists).

	- Emdash characters are now understood (in the same manner as
	  tab and hardreturn). (Courtesy of Graham Williams)

	- Added translation of <FPostScriptName> tag to "startpsfont" (in
	  the same manner as FTag currently gets translated to "startfont".
	  (Suggested by Lori Wong)

	Bug Fixes
	---------
	- The % character in MIF input (for numbers) is now ignored, so
	  no longer produces an error message about an unknown character
	  in the input.

	- Modified fixref script to overcome limitations in sed by using
	  split and multiple sed runs when there are lots of cross-refs.

	Notes
	-----
	- The manual for v0.2 has not been updated from v0.1.

miftran v0.1 24.Jan.94

	First release of miftran.

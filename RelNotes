miftran v0.3p1 10.Jun.1994

	Enhancements
	------------
	- Added support for simple variables.  Does not attempt to
	  translate <$xxx> stuff within variables, that text will appear
	  as is in the output.  The variables definition is handled with
	  <typesub varname ...> and <typesub vardef ...> commands, and the
	  reference is handled with <typesub varref ...>.

	- Added notes to the README file, simple directions for setting up
	  your own document.

miftran v0.3 1.Jun.1994

	Enhancements
	------------
	- Added recognition of hypertext commands.  These are done with
	  a miftran.rc line such as the following:
		<typesub hypertext gotolink `link to %s'>
	  The new format %H sets an internal flag that causes miftran
	  to look for a 'typesub hypertext endanchor' just before the
	  next font change.

	- Added recognition for hardspace and hardhyphen (similar to
	  hardreturn).

	- Added pgf.list and font.list tags to makefile, to make it easy
	  to get a list of the paragraph and font tags used in the mif file.

	- Added new format %n to add a conditional newline if the last
	  character of the data is a space.

	- Added purify tag to miftran makefile.

	Bug Fixes
	---------
	- Fixed some memory bugs in the string op functions.

	- Changed "\n" in default string translation to "%n".  This prevents
	  extraneous spaces from being inserted into the output.

miftran v0.2p2 12.May.1994

	Enhancements
	------------
	- Added the MiftranIgnore paragraph type to the default miftran.rc
	  file to ignore headers and footers.

	- Added stringsub lines for French characters to miftran.rc
	  (courtesy of Fabrice Gaillard).

	Bug Fixes
	---------
	- If no cross-refs in fixref, just exit rather than bombing.

	- Added trailing space in German Umlaut character translations.

	- Added missing "{ 0 }" to trantabs for anchored frame stuff.

miftran v0.2p1 2.May.1994

	Enhancements
	------------
	- Added stringsub lines for German Umlauts to miftran.rc
	  (courtesy of Stefan Lohrum).

	Bug Fixes
	---------
	- Adding missing double quotes for href lines in fixchl.

miftran v0.2  25.Apr.1994

	Enhancements
	------------
	- The new <tagalias> rc command provides a mechanism for easily
	  specifying that one tag should be treated the same as another.
	  This also makes it simpler to customize the standard RC file
	  for your document tags, since the tagalias commands all appear
	  grouped together near the start of the RC file.

	- The new <init> rc command provides a mechanism for specifying
	  special translations to be executed immediately when reading
	  the RC file.  This is useful for such things as loading registers
	  with constant values (such as the document title).

	- The new commands <aframeid>, <aframefile> and <aframe> provide
	  for handling of anchored frames.  New lines in the default
	  miftran.rc file generate <img> lines in the output which
	  reference the input filename.  You'll still have to handle
	  the image format conversion outside of miftran.

	- The new %O operators "get" and "set" implement a simple symbol
	  table.  The format %1.2"get"O will use the name in string
	  register 2, retrieve that value, and store it into string
	  register 1.  The format %1.2"set"O will store the value from
	  string register 1 into the name specified by string register 2.
	  This feature is used for the default anchored frame conversion.

	- Modified fixindex script to handle Emphasis in index lines.

	- Added fixchl script to better deal with adding "Next Chapter" and
	  "Previous Chapter" links (rather than trying to do it in the
	  rc file).  Links are now placed at both the start and end of
	  each chapter file (if the corresponding next/previous chapter
	  file exists).

	- Emdash characters are now understood (in the same manner as
	  tab and hardreturn). (Courtesy of Graham Williams)

	- Added translation of <FPostScriptName> tag to "startpsfont" (in
	  the same manner as FTag currently gets translated to "startfont".
	  (Suggested by Lori Wong)

	Bug Fixes
	---------
	- The % character in MIF input (for numbers) is now ignored, so
	  no longer produces an error message about an unknown character
	  in the input.

	- Modified fixref script to overcome limitations in sed by using
	  split and multiple sed runs when there are lots of cross-refs.

	Notes
	-----
	- The manual for v0.2 has not been updated from v0.1.

miftran v0.1 24.Jan.94

	First release of miftran.

    Miftran v0.7p1						3.Oct.96

    Miftran is a general purpose MIF (Framemaker's Maker Interchange
    Format) translation program.  It was designed primarily to translate
    to HTML, but is flexible enough that it could be used for other
    translations.

    The latest version of miftran is most likely to be found in
       <URL:ftp://ftp.alumni.caltech.edu/pub/mcbeath/web/miftran/>

    Miftran has the following features:

	- Written in C (plus a few small sh scripts), easy to compile.

	- Externally configurable with a single configuration (RC) file,
	  which can be customized for each MIF file to be translated.
	  ALL output text is controlled by contents of RC file.

	- Based on paragraph and font tags (plus FWeight and FAngle).

	- Generates Table of Contents (based on chapters, etc.) and Index
	  (based on Index markers), controlled by configuration file.

	- Accepts a single MIF input file, but can produce multiple
	  output files (e.g. split by chapters, sections, etc.),
	  based on configuration file.

	- Converts cross-references and hypertext links to HTML links,
	  based on configuration file.

	- String substitution allows converting special characters.
	  Default template includes German, French, and Spanish characters.

	- Handles anchored frames for inline images (but does not do
	  image format conversion).

	- Handles flat tables.

	- Handles simple variables (without <$xxx> stuff).

	- Ignores hidden conditional text (when in text flow tagged HIDDEN).

	- For advanced users, the C source can be relatively easily
	  customized to recognize additional MIF constructs.

	- Freely redistributable with an MIT/X11 style copyright.
	  You can even put it into a commercial product and sell it if
	  you want, as long as you preserve and acknowledge our copyright.

	- Library of preconfigured translation files to simplify customization.

    Miftran has the following limitations:

	- Only handles single MIF files.  If your document is in multiple
	  MIF files, you can try concatenating them all into a single file,
	  and it might work for you (I have successfully done this).
	  Otherwise, you will have to process them one at a time.  You can
	  probably make this work by munging the html/Makefile and the sh
	  scripts.

	- Does not do format conversions of images in anchored frames.

	- Does not handle embedded image files.

	- May not handle all conditional text correctly.

	- Does not handle <$xxx> stuff in variables.

	- Does not handle paragraph formatting based on anything
	  other than tags.

    To unpack miftran:
    1. gunzip miftran.tgz
       This will produce miftran.tar.  gzip and gunzip are Gnu compression
       programs, widely available.  Use archie to find a site near you.
       If you don't have archie, you can look in ftp://usc.edu/pub/gzip/.
    2. tar xvf miftran.tar
       This will create the directory "miftran" containing the kit.
    3. cd miftran
       This puts you into the directory, where you can compile and test.

    To compile and test miftran:
    1. Do a "make" in this directory.  This will build the miftran program.
    2. Cd to the html directory and do another "make".  This will create
       a set of HTML files, one per chapter, for the miftran.mif manual.
    3. In the html directory, do a "make diff" to compare the html/*.html
       files against the htmlref/*.html files.  They should be identical.
    4. Run your favorite HTML browser starting at TOC.html.

    To use miftran on your own document:
    1. Create a working directory for your html files.
    2. Copy html/Makefile and html/miftran.rc file to your directory.
    3. Edit your Makefile, set MIF_SOURCE and MIFTRAN_DIR.
    4. Edit your miftran.rc, set the document title.
    5. Do a "make font.list pgf.list" in your directory; this will make a
       list of font and paragraph tags used in your document.
    6. Edit your miftran.rc to change the <tagalias> lines to refer to
       your font and paragraph tags as desired.
    7. Do a "make" in your directory.
    8. Run your favorite HTML browser starting at your TOC.html.
    9. Customize your miftran.rc as desired and redo step 5-7 as needed.
